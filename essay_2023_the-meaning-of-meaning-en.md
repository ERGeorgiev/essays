# The Meaning of Meaning

"Everything must return to dust" is what she said, rubbing her palms together, as the dark skin rolled off her hands. The little boy was astounded and finally understood her message. That little boy was Sigmund Freud and the woman was his mother. [[1](https://varchive.org/tpp/dreams.htm)|[IMAGE](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/freud/images/amalia.jpg)].

Many struggle to find meaning. Countless books try to help with the issue, a good example for one is "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl. Frankl was a Holocaust victim. Not only did he manage to survive, but he helped others find the strength to go on. He noticed that victims who gave meaning to their life were the most likely to survive. What kept Frankl going was love, as he would spend his time looking at the clouds, talking to his wife. When he was freed, he found that his family perished in Auschwitz. Despite his suffering, Frankl was met with apathy, as people had gone through so much, there was no empathy left to give. And yet... he carried on helping people, even today with his books [[1](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Viktor-Frankl)].
Through similar books and hardships, one can learn to find meaning, be it in projects, family, beautiful sunrises or even in boring routines.

Yet one question stands out - Why should there be a meaning?

To understand meaning further, let's treat it like a scientific issue, by taking it **to the *extreme***. 
For example, it's much easier to figure out if a plant is growing by comparing its height week by week, rather than second by second.

So then, let's expand the scope, lets dive deeper. Instead of "Why should there be a meaning?" we can ask "Do people even have a meaning?". One way to go about finding the answer, would be to try to remove meaning and observe the changes. Lets assume that people have meaning, and lets imagine that a person suddenly vanishes. Whoever was standing next to them would certainly be freaked out. Close relatives wouldn't be too happy either, especially if they received no inheritance. Some that will develop a certain debilitating condition called "sadness", but compared to the rest of the human population, this will be a very small group. For anyone that is not emotionally invested, the day goes on just like any other day.
From this we can conclude, that the missing person and any meaning tied to them will have a noticeable effect on a small group of people.

Lets continue. 

The next logical step, after making a single person vanish, would be to also vanish the group of people that were affected by his disappearance. This would certainly lead to a much larger effect, causing ripples of emotional stress across multiple family systems and possibly a national crisis revolving around the curious case of the "disappearing people". Some say it's street gangs, other say it's ghosts, while someone popular is making a YouTube video about his theory of alien abductions.
So far, we have found that the result of the disappearance of a person or a group, would be anything from individual stress to nationwide panic. Could that be the meaning that a person has?

Lets take it further to understand.

What if everyone were to vanish at the same time? If everyone disappears, there would be nobody left to grieve or even notice. Does this mean that there is no meaning to anyone, as in this case, it does not affect anything?

We can take it even further to understand. This time, lets take it further in time.

As eons pass, the Earth will continue to spin, the glow of the sun will change, and as it runs out of fuel, it slowly becomes a white dwarf, devouring nearby planets and creating a beautiful planetary nebula. And if that wasn't scary enough, wait until you find out that it's already half-way there [[1](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-age/en/#:~:text=Stars%20like%20our%20Sun%20burn,about%20halfway%20through%20its%20life.), [2](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html#:~:text=A%20white%20dwarf%20is%20what,core%20of%20the%20star%20remains.)]. If we say that one Earth year is equal to 100 million years, then Earth would have lived for about 40 out of its 95 years. As far as the universe is concerned - the Sun and Earth as we know them will come to an end relatively soon. 
If that happens and the universe still goes on, does that mean that whole planets lack meaning? Does the universe have meaning?

From the universe's perspective, these questions are now invalid. The universe is not aware of the concept of "meaning". The universe just is, similar to the Sun, the Earth and Mother Nature. The universe is the universe, with or without meaning.

All of this leads back to the concept of meaning and how specific it is to humans, and I say that as I have yet to see my cat ask about the meaning of life - it seems to value food over that. Meaning is tied to human emotion and human understanding. Life, planets, galaxies, the universe - they can go on just fine with or without the concept of meaning. A black hole or a dying sun may consume them, but they wouldn't care less. They are just space dust and rocks and they are simply there, because they are.

Do you see it yet?
Having a meaning, is not something that life has or has not.
It is something that humans have and something that humans give.
We give meaning to the universe.
We give meaning to planets, nature and life.
Without us there is no meaning.
Inversely, meaning is important to us, because meaning is what makes us human.

So what if you don't want to have a meaning? Does that make you less human? I don't think so. You are free to experience your human life in any way you see fit because you have free will, another rather human concept. The meaning of not having a meaning can be your meaning.

And If you are struggling, wondering, searching deep into the rabbit hole, asking questions that no one has the answer to - then maybe it's not a logical issue, and thinking may not be the solution. Maybe it's a concern of the heart, and feeling is the way to go. A happy heart can always answer such questions, better than any brain can.

When Freud's mom showed him how we come from dust, he was amused. From dust we come, and to dust we must return. Dust gives meaning, and the means to give meaning, and then it takes it back. But what meaning would you assign to dust? Well... any meaning that you see fit.

By the way, if the concept of dust sounds scary to you, you can easily replace it with star dust. In my opinion they are entirely interchangeable, and I think that you are a star.

In the end of the day, we are all people, and we want to be happy. Some have an easier time, while some are still learning. Meaning gives purpose to many, and it helps us grow. Through meaning we express ourselves and unleash the flame within, a flame that can make each one of us great. So... allow the human in you to have a meaning.
